## About The Project

SwiftLink is a modern, full-stack URL shortener built to be fast, reliable, and user-friendly. It allows users to create short, memorable links from long URLs, either anonymously or through a registered account.

This project was built to demonstrate a deep understanding of full-stack development with a focus on a different kind of backend architecture, utilizing a relational (SQL) database. It showcases skills in user authentication, database relationships, API design, and building a polished, interactive frontend.

### Key Features

-   **Anonymous & Authenticated Use:** Quickly shorten links without an account, or sign up to get more features.
-   **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login system built from scratch using `jose` for JWTs and `HttpOnly` cookies.
-   **Protected Dashboard:** A private dashboard for logged-in users to view and manage all their created links.
-   **Click Analytics:** Tracks the number of clicks for each shortened link.
-   **Custom Short Codes:** Uses `nanoid` to generate unique, random, and URL-friendly short codes.
-   **Efficient Redirection:** A fast and reliable redirection system that also increments the click count for analytics.
